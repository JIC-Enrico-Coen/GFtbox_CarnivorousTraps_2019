This is a computational model associated with the paper "Evolution of carnivorous traps from planar leaves through simple shifts in gene expression" by Christopher D. Whitewoods, Beatriz Gonçalves1, Jie Cheng, Minlong Cui, Richard Kennaway, Karen Lee, Claire Bushell, Man Yu, Chunlan Piao, and Enrico Coen, appearing in [Science 367, 91–96 (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aay5433)

The models are:

GPT\_CarnivorousTraps\_3D\_supp\_20191031  
GPT\_CarnivorousTraps\_2D\_20191031  GPT\_CarnivorousTraps\_3D\_20191031

The models can be run using the Matlab package GFtbox, which is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/JIC-Enrico-Coen/GrowthToolbox). GFtbox requires an installation of Matlab, which is commercial software available from [Mathworks](https://Mathworks.com).
